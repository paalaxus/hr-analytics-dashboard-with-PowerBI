## hr-analytics-dashboard-with-PowerBI

Built an eye-catching HR dashboard using Power BI. 
The project was started by importing data & creating an employee demographics page that gives the overall demographic outlook of the organization.
I then proceeded to create pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. 
Finally, I created an employee detail page that will provide all the important information about any employee with just a click. 
The dashboard was made interactive by exploring buttons, themes, slicers & filters.
