## hr-analytics-dashboard-with-PowerBI

Built an eye-catching HR dashboard using Power BI. 
The project was started by importing data & creating an employee demographics page that gives the overall demographic outlook of the organization.
I then proceeded to create pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. 
Finally, I created an employee detail page that will provide all the important information about any employee with just a click. 

The dashboard was made interactive

It includes slicers to filter information by either employee name or department depending on the page you are on.

Buttons were included to navigate between pages.
